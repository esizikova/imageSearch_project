Each Descriptor file should take the input of an image, and output the column vector,
along with it's size;

It is possible to have the descriptor have more arguments, however remeber to add
error handling if arguments are not provided! A good example is stackedHistogramLab.m.

Once you've added the descriptor, remeber to edit the createFunctionMap.m
function to add key and function handle!
